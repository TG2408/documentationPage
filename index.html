          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
          (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
          objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, 
            and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control 
            structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety 
            of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to 
                control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side 
                extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to 
                user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to 
                running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
                application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
                one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
              </p>

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
            </li>
            <li>
              Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
            </li>
            <li>
              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
            </li>

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different 
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have 
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most 
          Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs 
          which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

          <ul>
            <li>get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</li>

              <div class="code">

        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or 
              dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). 
              Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters 
              "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </li>
            <li>
              can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
              You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. 
              Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>    
      <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>
          With the keyword var. For example,<br>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              var x = 42.
            </code>
          </div>
          <br>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              x = 42.
            </code>
          </div>
          <br>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript 
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br>
          With the keyword let. For example,<br>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              let y = 13.
            </code>
          </div>
          <br>
        </p>
      </section>    
      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global 
          variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. 
          When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, 
          because it is available only within that function<br>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
          </div>
          <br>
        </p>
      </section>   
      <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web 
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global 
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
          <br>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window 
          or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame 
          name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, 
          you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
         <br>
        </p>
      </section>    
      <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
          The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable 
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign 
          and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

          <div class="code">
            <code>
              const PI = 3.14;

        <p>
          The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Six data types that are primitives:
              <ol>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript 
                  is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li>42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String "Howdy"</li>
                <li>(new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
              </ol>
